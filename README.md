Very easy Clip to cover the front cam of a mobile phone.
Tested on several Samsung phones and it works okay.

It was inspired by a friend having some tape on his camera to prevent it from making images while he does not want to. Because tape looks ugly, I decided to step in and make a 10 minutes design to work around this by having better appearance on the phone as well.
Thats were we are.

Its not like perfect secure seated, but as you want to have this Feature, you might be more Aware to do not loose the Clip :-)
